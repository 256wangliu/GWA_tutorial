This GitHub page provides several tutorials about techniques used to analyze genetic data. 

We have made scripts available for:
    1) All essential GWAS QC steps along with scripts for data visualization.
    2) Dealing with population stratification, using 1000 genomes as a reference.
    3) Association analyses of GWAS data.
    4) Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses.

The scripts downloadable from this GitHub page can be seen purely as tutorials and used for educational purposes, but can also be used as a template for analyzing your own data.
All scripts/tutorials from this GitHub page use freely downloadable data, commands to download the necessary data can be found in the scripts.

How to use the tutorials on this page:
The tutorials are designed to run on an UNIX/Linux computer/server. The first 3 tutorials contain both *.text as *.R scripts. The main scripts for performing these tutorials are the *.text scripts (respectively for the first 3 tutorials: 1_Main_script_QC_GWAS, 2_Main_script_MDS.txt, and 3_Main_script_association_GWAS.txt). These script will execute the *.R scripts, when those are placed in the same directory. 
Note, without placing all files belonging to a specific tutorial in the same directory the tutorials cannot be completed. 
Furthermore, the first 3 tutorials are not independent; they should be followed in the order given above, according to their number. For example, the files generated at the end of tutorial 1 are essential in performing tutorial 2. Therefore, those files should be moved/copied to the directory in which tutorial 2 is executed. In addition, the files from tutorial 2 are essential for tutorial 3.
The fourth tutorial (4_ PRS.doc) is a MS Word document, and runs independently of the previous 3 tutorials.

Note:
       The *.zip files contain multiple files, in order to successfully complete the tutorials it is essential to download all files form the *.zip files and upload them to your working directory.
    Opening the *.zip folders and PRS.doc file requires clicking on the folder/file followed by clicking on "View Raw"
