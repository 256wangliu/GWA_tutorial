# GWA_tutorial
=========================

**(Ivm overlap moeten we misschien even overleggen of we deze readme.md kort willen houden en de scripts meer verhalend maken/houden of hier meer uitleg en de scripts meer puur script)


This GitHub page provides several tutorials about techniques used to analyze genetic data. We have made scripts available for all essential GWAS QC steps along with scripts for data visualization. Furthermore, in-depth scripts for dealing with population stratification are provided using 1000 genomes as a reference. In addition, we provide a tutorial for PRS. 

The scripts downloadable from this GitHub page can be purely used for educational purposes, but also as a template for analyzing your own data.

All tutorials from this GitHub page use freely downloadable data, commands to download the necessary data can be found in the scripts. In addition, we have added a separate document containing scripts to download all data.
