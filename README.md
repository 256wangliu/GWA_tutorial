# GWA_tutorial
=========================

**(Ivm overlap moeten we misschien even overleggen of we deze readme.md kort willen houden en de scripts meer verhalend maken/houden of hier meer uitleg en de scripts meer puur script)


This GitHub page provides several tutorials about techniques used to analyze genetic data. We have made scripts available for:
- 1) All essential GWAS QC steps along with scripts for data visualization. 
- 2) Dealing with population stratification, using 1000 genomes as a reference. 
- 3) Association analyses of GWAS data.
- 4) Polygenic risk score (PRS) anaylses. 

The scripts downloadable from this GitHub page can be purely seen as tutorials and used for educational purposes, but can also be used as a template for analyzing your own data.

All scripts/tutorials from this GitHub page use freely downloadable data, commands to download the necessary data can be found in the scripts. In addition, we have added a separate document containing scripts to download all data. 

Content:
- 1_QC_GWAS.zip
- 2_Population_stratification.zip
- 3_Association_GWAS
- PRS.doc
- script_simulation
- downloads

Note:
- The first 3 tutorials are not independent, they should be followed in the order given above, according to their number.
- The .zip files contain multiple scripts, in order to succesfully complete the tutorials it is essential to download all files from these folders.
- Opening the .zip and PRS.doc folder/file requires clicking on the folder/file followed by clicking on "View Raw"
- The documents "script_simulation" and "downloads" are not essential for completing the tutorials.
